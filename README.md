type-parser
================

This is a light weight library that does nothing but parse a string to a given type. 
Supports all applicable java classes, such as Integer, File, Enum, Float etc., including generic Collection types/interfaces 
such as List, Set, Map, arrays and even custom made types. Also possible to register your own parsers.

See [User Guide] (https://github.com/drapostolos/type-parser/wiki).
